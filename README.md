# Kony_SPA_Camera
Using HTML/JavaScript APIs invoking the device camera in SPA

We cannot use Camera widget in Web application due to limitation. 
In this sample app we have overcome those limitations and using Javascript APIs.
We are able to launch the device camera on button and capture the image get then captured image rawbytes.

We can assign the rawBytes to the image widget or you can pass it t the service call too.
